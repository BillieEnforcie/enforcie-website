				<em>Maybe I'm more burnt out than I initially thought.</em>
			</p>

				So it's been a few weeks and I'm writing another blog post in HTML, rather than MarkDown, which means I'm 
				probably not going to be finishing that conversion script anytime soon. Truth is, between work, band stuff,
				and various other things, I haven't had much time to work on it as of late, and the project isn't interesting 
				enough for me to spend what limited free time I have working on it. Plus, I'm finding that writing in HTML like 
				this isn't so bad. I don't know, maybe I'll start working on it again in a month or two; on the other hand, I might 
				just say <em>fuck it</em> and just use a static site generator. Only time will tell.
			</p>
			<p class="blog-paragraph">
				I've got a few more things I might be interested in working on, but I'll keep my mouth shut about them for the moment.
				I feel like I sort of jinxed the MD-to-HTML converter by talking about it before it was close to being finished, plus 
				I don't want to bring up something now and feel like an ass when I decide to pump the brakes on it later. Basically I'm a coward.
			</p>

				As for what's happening on the music side of things, my band's playing a show in three weeks. I'm pretty excited about it, since 
				the venue we're playing tends to draw a solid crowd; also, we're playing on Black Friday, so I'm hoping that'll incline 
				people to show up, if only to get away from their shitty relatives for a night. We're working on a new LP, too, which is  
				another thing I have to look forward to. We've got most of the drum tracks laid down, so I'm hoping we'll be on track to 
				have it done by this coming spring, but I won't make any promises. I proposed a name change recently, since <em>Billie and the Haint</em> 
				seemed more fitting when it was just my solo project, but it was decided that we keep the old name. I'm fine with that, 
				since it means I don't have to go through and change the name on all of our accounts/social media. 
			</p>
			<p class="blog-paragraph">
				Speaking of social media, I'm trying to use it as little as possible these days. Honestly, that was kind of the point of this 
				whole website: I wanted a way to get my thoughts out there on the internet without having to deal with that addictive 
				corporate hellhole. I'm down to checking Twitter maybe once or twice a day, which is a hell of a lot better than the constant 
				ragescrolling I used to do when it was still on my home screen. I'm keeping it and my other accounts around to promote 
				stuff and check in with friends on occasion, but I'm sort of inclined to just delete everytyhing so I can avoid the 
				temptation of getting sucked back in. Lately I've been trying to immerse myself in the "small" internet, which is still 
				gratifying, but not in the easy and habit-forming way that mainstream social media can be.
			</p>
			<p class="blog-paragraph">
				Outside of that, I don't have much to report. Have a pleasant day/morning/evening, and I wish you safe travels on the web.
				Billie out.
