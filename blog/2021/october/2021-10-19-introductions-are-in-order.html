				Hi. Hello. This is my first blog post on this website. It might be my only blog post on this site for a while.
				I'm not too keen on hand-writing HTML for every single post, so I'll probably switch to MarkDown for the blog 
				and make my own MarkDown-to-HTML converter to get things just the way I want. The plan (so far) is to host the 
				code for this website on a git repository; from there I'll have a cron job/batch process that'll check the repo 
				for changes every hour or so and rebuild/upload this website if a change is detected. Given the nature of what 
				I'm doing, this seems to be a more sensible decision that using a database.
			</p>
			<p class="blog-paragraph">
				I develop software for a living and I like to code for personal stuff on occasion, so I'll probably be talking 
				about <strong>STUPID NERD SHIT</strong> on here, apologies in advance. Maybe I'll even complain about my job, that sounds like 
				a fun and relatable thing to write about. I'm in a meeting as I'm writing this, so that tells you how seriously 
				I've been taking it as of late. Thank god I'm not using this as some sort of portfolio thing.
				This is definitely going to veer into political content as well, so I'm expecting a lot of good hate mail from you 
				folks. Everything else will probably be ruminations on my personal life and a showcase of my <em>objectively superior</em> 
				taste in music. 
			</p>
			<p class="blog-paragraph">
				So anyways, I've got a meeting I should probably be paying attention to. I want to update this thing on a timely 
				basis but realistically I'll post more stuff when I feel like it and when I have the time. There's not a lot of content 
				right now, so feel free to read this post maybe two or three more times until you're satisfied. My email's at the 
				bottom of the page. Later.
