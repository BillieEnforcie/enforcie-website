                Hi. Hello again. It's been a bit over eight months, which is about as long as I can 
                stand to be away from this little blog. Sorry about the long wait (for all of the three 
                people that read this); I've been a combination of busy and unmotivated, though I have 
                tried to update this blog a few times this year. I suppose I just haven't had any thoughts
                profound enough to spur me to action in spite of my current depressive episode.
			</p>
			<p class="blog-paragraph">
                Regardless, I suppose I should write down some of my thoughts, or some kind of diatribe 
                about the state of the world or something I'm passionate about at the current moment. 
                So here goes: I am... plagued by a sense of dread, gnawing at the back of my mind. The 
                best way I can describe it is like a low murmur, a tiny voice whispering terrible truths 
                in an eldritch tongue that speaks directly to some primeval part of my psyche. Does that 
                make sense? The US-led world order <em>(read: empire)</em> is faltering in a significant way, 
                and rather than take logical measures to preserve it, if in a reduced capacity, the ruling 
                class seems intent on going for broke and ending their "golden age" in an orgy of blood 
                and squalor. They're not going to do anything about climate change, they'll ignore 
                the pandemic, scaling back their neo-colonial ambitions is out of the question, 
                and they sure as hell aren't going to improve things for people within their borders. No, 
                their solution is to turn their guns inward, ramping up the fascist police state while 
                imperialism burns the global south in its death throes. I suppose this is what you'd call 
                "the contradictions sharpening".
			</p>
			<p class="blog-paragraph">
                I suppose I shouldn't be too glum about things; after all, the ending of the current order 
                is an opportunity for a new system, one based on justice and equality, to take its place. 
                I'm just worried, is all. I'm worried for the people on the imperial periphery who will 
                have to weather climate change and the dying US war machine, I'm worried for my friends and comrades of 
                oppressed nationality and marginalized identity that will be targeted by the fascist scum, and 
                maybe I'm a little worried for myself, too. I know we're in for a long fight, but in the 
                meantime, I have a life to live, so I'll just have to steel myself and keep moving forward. 
                Be safe out there, comrades.
